# This Project Is On Hold!
I don't have much experience in exploits, and I haven't made much progress, so I'm putting this On Hold, this project is being temporarily replaced by SwitchHub.
SwitchHub: https://github.com/Cooleli912/SwitchHub


# SoftBrew
A hacking source for the Nintendo Switch.

# Before Starting
If anything on this Github page bricks your console, I am not responsible, Nintendo can probably recover your switch as long as you're not suspicous.
As of writing this, no activity has really happened yet, but I might actually be able to do something soon enough.

# About the exploit
The Browser in the Switch can run Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
This exploit does not require an SD Card but is reccomended in case of an exploit that allows running code.

# How it works
The Plan is to create a website that runs code on the switch, similar to that of the Wii U Legacy exploit, I know for sure that this is possible because the Wii U is very similar to the Switch.

# Knowledge
I have tested running my own website on the switch, and ALL functionality is present!
The switch modders need to arise from their holes and TRY to get this working!

# How to Submit your Knowledge
Note: Please don't swear in your submission, it isn't helpful to anyone.

1. Create a github issue.
2. Give it the tag exploit.
3. Write your knowledge of any exploit you know of.
4. Submit the issue!
