# SoftBrew
A hacking source for the Nintendo Switch.

# About the exploit
The Browser in the Switch can run Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
This exploit does not require an SD Card but is reccomended in case of an exploit that allows running code.

# How it works
The Plan is to create a website that runs code on the switch, similar to that of the Wii U Legacy exploit, I know for sure that this is possible because the Wii U is very similar to the Switch.

# Knowledge
I have tested running my own website on the switch, and ALL functionality is present!
The switch modders need to arise from their holes and TRY to get this working!
